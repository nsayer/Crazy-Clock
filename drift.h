/*
 * This is a common file with the code for a clock that gains or loses
 * time at a constant rate. To build one, you just set the defines
 * and include this file.
 *
 * The way the math works is that we need to figure out after how
 * many cycles do we want to add or remove a count. This system
 * allows that number to be a fraction.
 *
 * The macros required are:
 *
 * CYCLE_COUNT - the denominator of the fractional part
 * BASE_CYCLE_LENGTH - the whole number portion
 * NUM_LONG_CYCLES - the numerator of the fractional part
 * RUN_SLOW - define this to make the clock run slow, leave it out to run fast
