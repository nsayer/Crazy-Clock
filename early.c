 * This clock runs 20% fast for 50 minutes, then 10% slow for 100 minutes.
 * The idea is that this is for folks who set their clock 10 minutes fast
 * to keep from being late to things, but then find themselves compensating.
 *
 * This clock will be anywhere from on-time to 10 minutes fast... but you
 * won't be able to predict it (without comparing it to a proper clock).
